## Made a simple 3D game using Unity3D
Just for fun, trying to get used to C# &amp; Unity3D

You can access to my Unity3D code in **Roll a Ball/Assets** folder: 1)playerBall.cs 2)item.cs / 3)mainCamera.cs / 4)GameManagerLogic.cs
Also, there are total 3 stages (scenarios) in this game, and you can check that in Roll a **Ball/Assets/Scenes** folder.
